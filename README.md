# Cloud Carbon Coefficients (ccfcoef)

This tool calculates the coefficients used in [Cloud Carbon
Footprint](https://www.cloudcarbonfootprint.org/), an application that
estimates the energy (kilowatt-hours) and carbon emissions (metric tons CO2e)
from public cloud provider utilization. We use the [SPECpower_ssj2008 results](https://www.spec.org/power_ssj2008/results/)
to perform these calculations.

The original work was done by [David Mytton](http://davidmytton.co.uk/), and it is archived
[here](https://github.com/cloud-carbon-footprint/cloud-carbon-coefficients).

## Outputs

There are two outputs of this tool used in Cloud Carbon Footprint:

1. **Usage coefficients:** Values calculated within for Azure (min watts, max watts, GB/chip), 
  AWS (min watts, max watts, GB/chip) and GCP (min watts, max watts). Results will be in a 
  CSV file in the `output/` with the values for each CPU architecture for each cloud platform.

2. **Embodied emissions coefficients:** Values are calculated and output to CSV in 
  `output/` for each instance type for each cloud platform in `kgCO2e`.

## Setup

This command line is written in Python and manages its dependencies through
[poetry](https://python-poetry.org/). Steps: 

* Ensure you have or install Python 3.10 with `python3 --version`
* If you don't have it, install poetry: `curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -`
* Run `poetry install` to install dependencies
* Run `poetry run ccfcoef --help` to see the available commands or `poetry shell` to enter a virtualenv and then `ccfcoef --help`

## Basic usage

Looking at the help output, you can see the available commands:

```
$ poetry run ccfcoef --help

### Generating coefficients

* `usage-coefficients`: This command will calculate the usage coefficients for
  each cloud provider and output them to CSV in `output/`.

```
$ poetry run ccfcoef usage-coefficients -w

* `embodied-coefficients`: This command will calculate the embodied coefficients
  for each cloud provider and output them to CSV in `output/`.

```
$ poetry run ccfcoef embodied-coefficients -w

### Updating the SPECpower results

* `update-specpower`: This command will fetch a new version of the SPECpower
  results file from the SPEC website and save it to `data/`.

```
$ poetry run ccfcoef update-specpower

Updating SPECpower data...

```

## Advanced usage

Other commands are available to help investigate the data and the coefficients. Use
`poetry run ccfcoef COMMAND --help` for more information.

### SPECpower versioning

`ccfcoef` uses the last available SPECpower results file by default. You can
specify a different version with the `--spec-version` option. This is a global
option and will set the SPECpower version for all commands.

* `list-specs`: This command will display all available SPECpower results files
  in `data/`. See example below.

```
$ poetry run ccfcoef list-specs

Available SPECpower results files:
file: SPECpower-2023-05-01.csv version:2023-05-01
file: SPECpower-2023-04-28.csv version:2023-04-28
file: SPECpower-2023-04-27.csv version:2023-04-27
file: SPECpower-2023-04-06.csv version:2023-04-06
file: SPECpower-2022-03-01.csv version:2022-03-01

$ poetry run ccfcoef --spec-version 2022-03-01 cpu-averages --family intel-coffeelake
